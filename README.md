# Building a Production-Ready RAG-based LLM Python Application

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to creating a scalable, high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) application using Python. The goal is to process an extensive collection of documents efficiently, utilizing the combined power of Ray for distributed computing, ChromaDB for vector storage, and LangChain. This application is designed to go beyond basic chatbot functionalities, aiming to handle complex, large-scale data processing tasks.

## Project Components

### 1. **[Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) (Distributed Computing):**
 - Manage and scale workloads across multiple nodes.
 - Distribute tasks like loading, chunking, embedding, indexing, and serving efficiently.

### 2. **[ChromaDB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) (Vector Store):**
 - Store and retrieve large-scale vector data.
 - Optimize embedding and indexing processes for performance.

### 3. **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain):**
 - Utilize for building generating embeddings and chunking.

## Overview
### documents_loader.py
This Python script is designed to automate the process of fetching, downloading, and ingesting academic papers from the arXiv database.
-   **Fetch Papers**: Retrieve a list of paper URLs from arXiv based on a search query.
-   **Download Papers**: Concurrently download papers from the fetched URLs.
-   **Ingest Documents**: Extract text and metadata from the downloaded PDF documents.
### splitter.py
This script is designed to chunk large text sections into smaller, more manageable pieces.
-   **Chunking Text Sections**: Breaks down larger text sections into smaller chunks based on specified size and overlap parameters.
### embeddings.py
-   **Text Embedding**: Converts text chunks into embeddings using selected models from OpenAI or HuggingFace.

### storage.py
This script provides functionality for storing and querying documents in a ChromaDB collection, which is beneficial for managing large datasets with embedded textual data.
-   **Document Storage in ChromaDB**: Manages the addition of batches of documents to a ChromaDB collection.
-   **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single, consistent instance manages the database connection.

### retrieval.py
Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve the recall of retrieved documents. This script is designed for augmenting and generating multiple related queries using an OpenAI language model.

-   **Query Augmentation**: Enhances a given query by generating an augmented version using a language model.
-   **Multiple Related Query Generation**: Creates several related queries based on the input query to cover different aspects of a given topic.

### generation.py
This script is designed to act as a virtual assistant for research purposes, capable of augmenting queries, retrieving relevant documents, and generating informed responses.
-   **Comprehensive Query Processing**: Enhances, retrieves, and generates responses to user queries using advanced NLP models and methods.
-   **Document Retrieval and Re-ranking**: Retrieves relevant documents and re-ranks them based on their relevance to the query.

### trulens_evaluation.py

This script establishes a feedback and evaluation system for a `ResearchAssistant` class using [TruLens](https://github.com/truera/trulens/), an evaluation library.
-   **Feedback and Evaluation System**: Implements a comprehensive system to evaluate the performance of a research assistant model on specific NLP tasks.
-   **Integration with TruLens**: Utilizes TruLens for monitoring and assessing the performance of the model.
